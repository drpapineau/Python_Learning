Well after many years of procrastination I decides that passive 
learning was not for me ... And this time
I will try Active learning through small project

" Mad Libs Generator "

One of the best ideas to start experimenting you
hands-on python projects for students is working 
on Mad Libs Generator. This is the perfect project
for beginners who are just starting out with software
development. Primarily focused on strings, variables, 
and concatenation, this project will teach you how to
manipulate user-inputted data. The program design is
such that it will ask users to enter a series of
inputs that will be considered as a Mad Lib.

" Number Guessing "


This is a simple yet exciting idea. You can even
call it a mini-game. Make a program in which the
computer randomly chooses a number between 1 to 10,
1 to 100, or any range. Then give users a hint to
guess the number. Every time the user guesses wrong,
he gets another clue, and his score gets reduced.
The clue can be multiples, divisible, greater or
smaller, or a combination of all.

You will also need functions to compare the inputted
number with the guessed number, to compute the
difference between the two, and to check whether 
an actual number was inputted or not.
